# Beholder Basic Setup

## Windows
- Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed
- Clone the repo and open a terminal at the root folder
- Run `npm install`
- Replace the `Native` folder with the correct Native C++ programs that have been shared with you
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `npm start` and the app should open
- *If you have issues with the camera feed try terminating the app and restarting it. You can tell the app is loading properly if the green play button appears.*

## When developing
- Use the `npm run dev` command instead of the `build` command (this will automatically rebuild the JS when)
- Then open a separate terminal window to run `npm start`
